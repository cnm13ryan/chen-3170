# Methane combustion in air (corrected chatgpt)
#
#Simplified combustion reaction mechanism for methane in air, extended to 10 reactions:
#
#    Initiation: 
CH4 + OH^* -> CH3^* + H2O
#
#  Propagation:
CH3^* + O2 -> CH3O2^*
CH3O2^* + NO -> CH3O^* + NO2
CH3O^* + O2 -> CH2O + HO2^*
HO2^* + NO -> OH^* + NO2
#
# Termination:
#CH3O2^* + CH3O2^* -> CH3O + O2 + CH3O2H
2 CH3O2^* -> 2 CH3O + O2
CH3O^* + NO -> CH3ONO
CH3O^* + HO2^* -> CH2O + H2O + O^*
2 OH^* -> H2O2
CH3O^* + CH3^* -> C2H6^* + O^*
#
#The above mechanism is a simplified version of the full combustion mechanism, which involves numerous intermediate species and #reactions. However, it captures the main steps involved in the combustion of methane in air.
#
#Note that the combustion of methane is an exothermic reaction, which means it releases energy in the form of heat. This reaction #is used in many industrial and household applications, including cooking, heating, and electricity generation. However, it also #contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases, which have a significant impact on global climate change.
